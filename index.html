<h2 id="philter">Philter Comparison</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Designed a <strong>data pipeline and framework using Python</strong> for comparing the performance of UCSF’s clinical note de-identification
software to an alternative algorithm in order to pinpoint notes that UCSF’s algorithm was not able to de-identify completely.</li>
  <li>Devised a method of output comparison using <strong>numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn</strong> that flagged notes which caused the two algorithms
to produce contrasting results over metrics such as the percentage of correctly identified PHI tokens and the <strong>cosine similarities.</strong></li>
  <li>Created a <strong>Python script for preprocessing output files into an XML file format</strong> mimicking gold standard PHI annotations.</li>
</ul>
